        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>Chickpeas</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Tomato puree</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak raw chickpeas overnight in enough water to cover them. <br> Drain the water after soaking.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chickpeas to a stovetop pressure cooker, add around 5 cups of water and 1 teaspoon of salt. Stir and close the lid of the pressure cooker. Pressure cook at high heat for 1 to 2 whistles. <br> After that, lower the heat to medium and let the chickpeas cook for another 10 to 12 minutes. Then turn off the heat and let the pressure release naturally.</li>
            <li>Remove the cooker from heat and allow it to cool down. Once the steam is gone, open the cooker and check the chickpeas. You should be able to press them easily with your fingers. If not, close the cooker and cook for 2 more whistles.</li>
            <li>Heat a pot or kadai on medium heat. Once hot, add 1 to 1 & 1/2 tablespoons of oil to it. Then add 2 whole bay leaves and 3/4 cup grated onions to the pot.</li>
            <li>Fry the onions until the raw smell goes away and they are light golden brown in color, this takes around 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 2 teaspoons of ginger garlic paste and cook for 2 minutes until the raw smell goes away.</li>
            <li>Now, add 2 & 1/2 cups of tomato puree (from 4 medium tomatoes/around 435 grams) and stir.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot and cook the tomatoes for around 15 minutes on medium-low heat, stir every 2 to 3 minutes in between. </li>
            <li>Once the tomatoes are cooked, add the spices:
                <ul>
                <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (you can use 3/4 or 1/2 teaspoon if you are not good with spice) </li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (Or to taste) </li>
                <li>Stir and cook the spices for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add the boiled chickpeas (along with the water in which they were boiled) to the pan now and stir until the chickpeas are well combined with the rest of the masala. <br>Add an extra 1/2 cup water and then cover the pan and let it simmer on medium-low heat for around 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 30 minutes the gravy, chickpeas and all the spices would have mixed well together. It is ready to serve now, Enjoy.</li>
